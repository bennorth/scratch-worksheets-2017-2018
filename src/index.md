I was recently part of a group of volunteers who led a twelve-week after-school Scratch programming class, aimed at 10&ndash;12-year-olds.  Below are the worksheets I created for these classes, with some notes on how we got on with them.  Any errors are mine.


# Week 1

We introduced everyone to the puzzle game [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/), and thought about the connections to Scratch.  We'll aim to get across the idea that you can make a system which interprets user-provided instructions.  From there it's only a change of scale to realise that you could make Scratch itself with enough work &mdash; it's not magic.

I was hoping the students would get a bit further, but most got the hang of what they were trying to do within SpaceChem, and we had a brief discussion at the end regarding connections to Scratch.

# Week 2

(I tried to lead this class from the front, but this did not work very well at all.  I made the worksheet after the fact.)

We started by making the reactor's grid of cells.

Some students got most of the way through this, although I think the material was quite fast-moving for many of them.  This week therefore served as a bit of a calibration exercise as to how much we could expect to get done in a session.

At the end of the worksheet, the project should look like this:
