I was recently part of a group of volunteers who led a twelve-week after-school Scratch programming class, aimed at 10&ndash;12-year-olds.  Below are the worksheets I created for these classes, with some notes on how we got on with them.  Any errors are mine.


# Week 1

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="week-01/Scratch-worksheets-2017-2018-week-01.pdf"><img src="week-01/worksheet.png"></a></div>

We introduced everyone to the puzzle game [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/), and thought about the connections to Scratch.  We'll aim to get across the idea that you can make a system which interprets user-provided instructions.  From there it's only a change of scale to realise that you could make Scratch itself with enough work &mdash; it's not magic.

I was hoping the students would get a bit further, but most got the hang of what they were trying to do within SpaceChem, and we had a brief discussion at the end regarding connections to Scratch.

# Week 2

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="week-02/Scratch-worksheets-2017-2018-week-02.pdf"><img src="week-02/worksheet.png"></a></div>

(I tried to lead this class from the front, but this did not work very well at all.  I made the worksheet after the fact.)

We started by making the reactor's grid of cells.

Some students got most of the way through this, although I think the material was quite fast-moving for many of them.  This week therefore served as a bit of a calibration exercise as to how much we could expect to get done in a session.

At the end of the worksheet, the project should look like this:

# Week 3

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="week-03/Scratch-worksheets-2017-2018-week-03.pdf"><img src="week-03/worksheet.png"></a></div>

We next made instruction arrows which the player can drag on to the reactor.  There is some maths involved for snapping the dropped arrow to the centre of a cell, which I don't think everyone fully followed all details of, but most got the main points of the worksheet done.  A few of the students had good 'aha!' moments when they grasped the concept of defining and using a custom block.

At the end of the worksheet, the project should look like this:

# Week 4

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="week-04/Scratch-worksheets-2017-2018-week-04.pdf"><img src="week-04/worksheet.png"></a></div>

Here we added the 'Waldo', the robot which follows the instructions.  Most students got Waldo successfully following arrows round the reactor.  There was quite a bit of material which hardly any student got to, but it's probably better to err on the side of having spare material, rather than running out.

At the end of the worksheet, the project should look like one of these (the second has the challenges from the worksheet done as well):
