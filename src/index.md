I was recently part of a group of volunteers who led a twelve-week after-school Scratch programming class, aimed at 10&ndash;12-year-olds.  Below are the worksheets I created for these classes, with some notes on how we got on with them.  Any errors are mine.

We introduced everyone to the puzzle game [SpaceChem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/), and thought about the connections to Scratch.  We'll aim to get across the idea that you can make a system which interprets user-provided instructions.  From there it's only a change of scale to realise that you could make Scratch itself with enough work &mdash; it's not magic.

I was hoping the students would get a bit further, but most got the hang of what they were trying to do within SpaceChem, and we had a brief discussion at the end regarding connections to Scratch.
