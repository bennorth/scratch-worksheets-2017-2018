<p>I was recently part of a group of volunteers who led a twelve-week after-school Scratch programming class, aimed at 10–12-year-olds. Below are the worksheets I created for these classes, with some notes on how we got on with them. Any errors are mine.</p>

<p>We introduced everyone to the puzzle game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>, and thought about the connections to Scratch. We'll aim to get across the idea that you can make a system which interprets user-provided instructions. From there it's only a change of scale to realise that you could make Scratch itself with enough work — it's not magic.</p>
<p>I was hoping the students would get a bit further, but most got the hang of what they were trying to do within SpaceChem, and we had a brief discussion at the end regarding connections to Scratch.</p>
