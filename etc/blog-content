The school my three youngest children go to runs after-school activities, and I was part of a group of volunteers who ran an 'Advanced <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>' course.  This was aimed at 10â€“12-year-olds who had done a reasonable amount of Scratch already, and wanted to explore more.

We spent several sessions developing a much-simplified version of the great puzzle game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>, and then a few standalone projects.  It went pretty well, with most of the students getting a lot done.

As part of this, I wrote a set of worksheets, which I've now tidied up and made available under CC-BY-SA in case they're of interest to anyone else:
