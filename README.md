# Scratch worksheets from 2017/18

I was recently part of a group of volunteers who led a twelve-week after-school [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) programming class for 10&ndash;12-year-olds.  As part of this, I created a set of worksheets for the students.  This repo publishes them.  See:

* [Scratch Worksheets 2017/18](https://bennorth.github.io/scratch-worksheets-2017-2018/)

for presentation and some further discussion.
